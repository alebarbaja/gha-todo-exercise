# To Do PWA

The typical To Do application.

I created this project to practice using Vue.js and TailwindCSS.
I also wanted to create a Progressive Web App that I can use on my devices.

---
### Tech Stack
- Vue.js 2.6.0
- TailwindCSS 1.0
- Service workers.

I used the pre-built versions of Vue.js and Tailwind CSS in this project, rather than configuring and installing them from scratch.
